# Git resources
Resources that are useful for learning and using Git.

## Happy Git with R
Jenny Bryan's **Happy Git with R** (https://happygitwithr.com/) is a great resource for getting started and for troubleshooting. It has particularly good advice for data science workflows, which are different from software development workflows (which are the target of most tutorials), and specifically for R and R markdown.

## The Pro Git book
**Pro Git** (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) by Chacon & Straub is the official Git book. It's very clearly written, practical, and an excellent resource. Return to it often.

## Software carpentry
We'll do some of the tutorials on Git-GitHub from software carpentry at https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/ but the other tutorials are useful too.

## Codecademy tutorials

For extra practice Codecademy (https://www.codecademy.com/pt-BR/learn/learn-git) make some nice interactive tutorials and their lessons are very clear and stripped of distracting side notes. The lessons are clearer than those at Software Carpentry. You need to make a free account and give your credit card details to get free access to the Pro version (needed for these tutorials) for 7 days. The first lesson in each of the major topics is a good overview:

  * Basic Git Workflow
  * How to Backtrack in Git
  * Git branching
  * Git teamwork

You probably need to remember to cancel your subscription if you don't want to be charged $20 after the 7 day trial period.

## Hadley Wickham's RStudio guide
Hadley Wickham's guide to Rstudio with Git and GitHub http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html is especially good for the Git tools built into RStudio. It is written from the perspective of R package development but approaches discussed are essentially the same for data science projects.

## Earth Lab tutorials
If you're coming to the class as a Python user (rather than R), here are two lessons from Earth Analytics' git/github tutorials that could be useful. They have user-friendly step-by-step instructions with visuals. They're for using Jupyter notebooks with Python, but the interaction with the command line is the same.
