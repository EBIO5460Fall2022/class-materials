### Week 11: Preclass preparation for Mon-Wed

R markdown,  individual proposals, multilevel models. Aim for (1) plus any catch up reading and code review from last week for Mon, (2)-(3) for Wed.



#### 1. Skill of the week: R markdown

* [repsci04_rmarkdown.md](skills_tutorials/repsci04_rmarkdown.md)




#### 2. Individual project proposal

Read the guidelines for the individual project:

* [00_individual_project.md](00_individual_project.md)

Review these guidelines now and please ask me for any clarifications etc. I probably haven't thought of everything you might need to know. Also, we haven't covered everything mentioned here yet but we will.

Next, expand and finalize your proposal. I will first review your bullet points from last week. Wait until I get back to you about that. Then, you should expand your bullet points with a bit more detail to turn in a brief final project proposal (about half a page).

Save as a markdown or text file to your repo and **push to GitHub by Wednesday**.




#### 3. Read and investigate code for multilevel models Parts III & IV of the radon example

Be sure to do the multilevel reading and code review from last week before moving forward with these.

* [12_2_radon_multilevel_3.md](12_2_radon_multilevel_3.md): part III includes a house-scale predictor
* [12_3_radon_multilevel_4.md](12_3_radon_multilevel_4.md) part IV adds a county-scale predictor and demonstrates the Bayesian analysis with `stan_lmer()`.
* Cross reference Chapter 12 of Gelman & Hill.
