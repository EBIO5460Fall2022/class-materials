### Week 15 +

This week is dedicated to your individual project, including one final topic from Monday's lecture that you'll apply: fake data simulation and its application in Bayesian analysis as a posterior predictive check. Officially the last day for assessable work is Wed 14 Dec (last day of finals), so that will be the day for completing your GitHub portfolio, including your independent project. Push to GitHub no later than **11:59 PM 14 Dec 2022**. However, if you need more time, let me know. I can probably accommodate an extension of a couple more days but grades are due very soon after 14 Dec.



#### 1. Research the default priors for independent project

Research the default priors for your model in the `rstanarm` documentation. Give the exact parameter values for the priors (e.g. $\sigma$ = 2.5) for both the scaled priors and the priors on the original scale of the predictor variables. Bonus points for plotting the priors! **Justify these choices** or any deviations you made from the defaults. This must be included in your submitted materials for your independent project. See also [10_9_ants_bayesian_GLM_priors.md](10_9_ants_bayesian_GLM_priors.md).  



#### 2. Posterior predictive check for independent project

Conduct a posterior predictive check for the model in your independent project. Use the `pp_check()` function **directly in your code**. See [15_4_ants_bayes_diagnostics.md](15_4_ants_bayes_diagnostics.md). You can also look at the various plots of posterior predictive checks in `shinystan` and comment on those in your independent project report but this will be in addition to (not a substitute for) the required `ppcheck()` code. **Comment** on whether these diagnostic plots seem OK or if they flag any potential problems with the model. This must be included in your submitted materials for your independent project. 



#### 3. Independent project completed

See [00_individual_project.md](00_individual_project.md) to be reminded of the guidelines for what should be included, format etc. Also see the independent project checklist in [00_portfolio_checklist.md](00_portfolio_checklist.md). If any of these items seem incompatible with your project, just send me an email and we'll work out an appropriate approach.



#### 4. GitHub portfolio completed

See  [00_portfolio_checklist.md](00_portfolio_checklist.md). This is a comprehensive list that includes all of the pieces that were marked as "Push to GitHub" in the homework. If you've submitted these, you're good, including if you submitted revisions on weeks 1-4. For weeks 5+ no revisions will be needed (if you've submitted them, you're good).



#### Grades

Are based on completion. There is 1 point for each completed piece in the portfolio checklist.
