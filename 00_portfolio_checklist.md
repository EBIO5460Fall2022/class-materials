### Checklist for your GitHub portfolio

Current through week 5

Your grade is based on completion of required elements (everything marked as "push to GitHub" in homework). This is what you need to complete and upload to GitHub. Please make it easy for me to find these, preferably by naming your script files by week or organizing them into weekly folders, and collecting all the individual project files together.
