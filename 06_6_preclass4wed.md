### Week 6: Preclass preparation for Wed

1. **Likelihood inference algorithm with your data**
   
   * Using the approach in [06_3_likelihood_inference.md](06_3_likelihood_inference.md)  (e.g. see code in Summary) calculate 1/8 likelihood intervals for the intercept, slope, and standard deviation. Compare the intervals for the intercept and slope to the classical confidence intervals.  **Push to GitHub.**

2. **Skill of the week: reproducible science**
   
   * Read [repsci01_reproducible_science.md](skills_tutorials/repsci01_reproducible_science.md).
   * Get set up to write markdown documents: [repsci02_markdown.md](skills_tutorials/repsci02_markdown.md).
