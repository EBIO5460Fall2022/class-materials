### Week 11: Preclass preparation for Mon-Wed

This week we'll extend into multilevel models, learn about tidy data, and start thinking about your individual project. Aim to have at least 1-3 done by Monday.



#### 1. Individual project

Think about what data you will use for your individual project. Pick something that will challenge you. For greatest synergy with your research, use a dataset of your own that you'd like to progress the analysis for.

##### Do you have a dataset with multilevel structure?

As our major topic for the next few weeks is multilevel models, an excellent choice would be a dataset that has multilevel structure. This means that it has grouping variables of some sort. Here are five examples. 1) In our fragmentation experiment in Australia, we have a nested structure with fragments randomly assigned to three sizes within experimental blocks, sites within fragments stratified into edges and interiors, and samples taken over many years within sites. Grouping structures in that experiment therefore include "blocks", "fragments", and "sites". 2) You might have experimental data from the lab with multiple measurements on individuals over time and individuals randomized to treatments. The grouping structure in this experiment would be "individuals". 3) In the globally distributed [Nutnet experiment](http://www.nutnet.umn.edu/) there are multiple sites, and nutrient treatments within sites arranged in randomized blocks. The grouping structures in this experiment would be "sites" and "blocks". 4) You might have measurements from different lakes in different catchments. 5) You might be interested in how traits evolved among families and you have species within families. And so on. Most datasets in ecology and evolution are structured in some way like these examples.

##### What are the distributional characteristics of your data?

The response variable(s) could potentially be generated by any kind of stochastic process, represented approximately by some distribution, such as binomial (e.g. species occurrence data), Poisson (e.g. species richness), exponential (e.g. survival times), Normal (e.g. tree height), lognormal (e.g. nitrogen deposition rate), or whatever. Remember that we are not usually concerned with the distribution of explanatory (predictor) variables.

##### I don't have a dataset of my own

A *reanalysis* is an excellent option if you don't have data of your own. It could be a Bayesian reanalysis of a dataset previously done as frequentist. Is there a paper that inspires you or is connected to your work that you would love to look deeply into to learn more? Do you think you could improve upon a previously published analysis? Or perhaps there's a previous analysis from your lab that might be interesting to see through a Bayesian lens. Of course, the data would need to be available or easily reproducible.

##### Too many options?

If you have several options and are unsure which is best, jot down a few notes about each and I'll help you decide.

##### Here's what to do for this week's assignment:

Jot down a few preliminary bullet points:

* What are the scientific questions?
* Characteristics of the dataset (size, types of variables, possible distribution, etc)
* How are the data structured? (i.e. grouping factors)

Save as a markdown or text file to your repo and **push to GitHub**.



#### 2. Skill of the week: tidy data

Most standard statistical analyses, particularly regression-style models, require data in tidy format. It's handy to have some tools for getting data into that format. Follow along in this chapter of R for Data Science:

#### 3. Reading for multilevel models (Ch 12 Gelman & Hill)

Find it in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hwgN0sMifgYSMrf8aOi4cJbjRKyTEKoT?usp=sharing) under Texts. Read sections up to and including 12.4 (pp 251-262). The main concepts are:

* Notation

* Partial pooling (shrinkage) versus no pooling versus complete pooling

* Using `lmer()` from the lme4 package

  

#### 4. Radon multilevel part 1 (basics) - R code

This is the analysis in Gelman & Hill Ch 12. Take a look at the R code `11_3_radon_multilevel` in the class repo:

* Examples of exploratory data analysis using `dplyr()` and `ggplot()`
* Multilevel modeling using the frequentist `lmer()` from `lme4` and Bayesian `stan_lmer()` from `rstanarm`



#### 5. Reading for multilevel models (Ch 12 Gelman & Hill) (1-2 hours)

So far we have read through the end of section 12.4. Next read:

1. 12.5 Writing the model. Up to Eq. 12.9 (top of p 264)
2. 12.6 Group level predictors
3. 12.7.4 Statistical significance
4. 12.8 Predictions for new observations and new groups
