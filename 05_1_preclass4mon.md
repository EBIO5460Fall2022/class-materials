### Week 5: Preclass preparation for Mon

Make sure you're caught up on any previous work and you've pushed all your work to GitHub!



#### 1. Feedback for me

Let me know how the class is going for you so far. I want to check in about homework and how the flipped format is working. Please fill out the qualtrics survey here:

#### 2. Prediction intervals

Using `lm()` with your dataset, make and plot prediction intervals for `y|x` (i.e. the interval around the fitted mean line). Also plot confidence intervals if you didn't already.  **Push your R script to GitHub.**



#### 3. Skill of the week: how to try out new code with Git

When you have an alternative way to do something in code, say for example, a different version of an algorithm, or a different algorithm for the same problem, you can try it out by creating a new branch in your repository. Branches are for coding experiments. If your experiment works out you can merge it back in to the main branch.

#### 4. Reading on the bootstrap algorithm

   * [05_2_bootstrap_algo.md](05_2_bootstrap_algo.md)



#### 5. Apply bootstrap to your linear dataset

Use the **empirical** bootstrap algorithm to calculate 95% confidence intervals for the parameters and confidence bands for y. Use the percentile method to do this. Note that this is not simply running your data through my code: you will need to combine aspects of the code that I introduced in different places. **Push your code to GitHub.**
