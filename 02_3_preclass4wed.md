### Week 2: Preclass homework for Wednesday

Reflecting about the data analysis process.



#### 1. Flowchart, pseudocode, code

Complete the flowchart, pseudocode, and R code for the two algorithm exercises from Monday's class.  A photo (e.g. as a .jpg or .pdf) of a hand-drawn flowchart, or hand-written pseudocode is fine. For photos, I suggest saving in a moderate resolution standard format (e.g. about 100 kb file size .jpg). **Push your files to your GitHub repository**. To push, you first commit to your local repository, then do

   ```bash
   git push
   ```



#### 2. Linear regression reflection. 

Use the R function `lm()` to analyze a dataset that has a linearish relationship between y and x. This should be a simple linear regression (no multiple regression models)  just y and one continuous variable x. This should preferably be an analysis you've done before, either as part of your research, or in a previous statistics class. It should be a complete analysis from question to conclusion. I want you to reflect on this seemingly simple task. Your R script should be well commented, including what question you were asking (i.e. what was the goal of your analysis?) and how the analysis answers that question. You might highlight areas that you're not sure about, output that you don't fully understand etc. This is a low stakes reflection. I'm not asking you to get it right or do it perfectly but to set a starting point for your learning journey this semester.  **Push your R script to your GitHub repository**.



#### 3. Consider your workflow as an algorithm.
Make a flow diagram or sketch of your data analysis workflow for the simple linear regression you just did (e.g. like the "get to work algorithm"). What steps did you go through to get from question to conclusion? We will discuss these together on Monday and begin to outline a best-practice workflow for data science. A photo of a hand drawn sketch is fine (e.g. saved as < 100kb .jpg). **Push your diagram to your GitHub repository**.
